    "\n",
    "A steady upward or downward slope when the data is plotted over time.\n",

    "Cycles are longer and more variable in length compared to seasonal patterns.\n",
    "Typically identified by observing cycles over several years, using techniques like autocorrelation or moving averages to smooth data.\n",

    "#### Interpretation \n",
    "In finance, business cycles (expansion and contraction phases) are common cyclic patterns.\n",
    "In climate science, cycles like El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a represent long-term weather fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise\n",
    "They are the unpredictable variations that do not follow a pattern and cannot be attributed to trend, seasonality or cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identification:\n",
    "These fluctuations appear as erratic spikes or drops in data.\n",
    "Randomness can be detected after removing trend and seasonal components, using decomposition methods such as additive or multiplicative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intrepretation:\n",
    "Random fluctuations often represent external, uncontrollable events such as economic shocks, natural disasters, or random market behavior.\n",

It combines three key components‚Äîautoregression (AR), differencing (I for integration), and moving average (MA)‚Äîto capture various aspects of time series data, such as trends and seasonality.
